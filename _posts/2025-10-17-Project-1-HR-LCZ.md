## Abstract

As climate change intensifies, understanding heat resilience (HR) in urban environments is crucial for developing climate-resilient cities. While numerous studies have examined the relationship between urban form and urban heat islands (UHI), few have focused on HR, often limiting their analysis to single extreme heat events. Additionally, translating complex urban form findings into practical urban planning policies remains challenging. The concept of local climate zones (LCZ) offers a thermally-based classification of urban forms, which is more accessible for policymakers. However, most LCZ studies focus on UHI, with little attention to HR. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the relationship between LCZs and HR in New York City. HR is defined as the difference in land surface temperature (LST) between extreme heat and normal heat days. Using Landsat 8 imagery from 2010 to 2019 and selecting days with minimal cloud cover, the study identifies three pairs of heat events based on air temperature percentiles. LCZ map and GIS data, combined with census tract information, are analyzed using a spatial panel model to assess the influence of different LCZs and large-scale landscapes on HR. The results reveal that LCZ 1 (Compact high-rise) and LCZ 4 (Open high-rise) significantly increase HR compared to LCZ 2 (Compact mid-rise), while LCZ 3 (Compact low-rise) reduces HR. Additionally, HR is significantly elevated during extreme events with higher temperatures in normal heat days and greater temperature increases between normal and extreme heat days. These insights offer valuable guidance for urban planners and policymakers in designing heat-resilient cities by incorporating the LCZ framework into climate adaptation strategies and urban governance.
