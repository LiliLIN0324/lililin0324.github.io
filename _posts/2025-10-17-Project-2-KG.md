## Abstract
This study extracts and compares urban planning knowledge from New York City and Shanghai master plans—created in different linguistic and cultural contexts—by representing them as knowledge graphs (KGs). Ten critical topics (five related to climate change adaptation and five to urban planning) serve as the KG nodes. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques and generative large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are then applied to generate and compare the edges connecting these nodes. Expert validation reveals that while LLM-based methods capture semantic nuances more effectively, they often lack the interpretability crucial for practical implementation. To address this, a new hybrid approach combining topic modeling and LLMs is proposed, offering both accuracy and transparency. Overall, this research underscores the potential of NLP-based methods—particularly the hybrid approach—to illuminate urban planning concepts in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, facilitating broader knowledge sharing and policy adaptation worldwide. The resulting KGs can serve as a valuable resource for transferring planning strategies, especially to the Global South, advancing climate adaptation solutions and more informed planning practices.
