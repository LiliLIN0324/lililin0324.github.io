**Abstract**
Climate change has been a pressing global issue in the recent decades as it increasingly influences human life through extreme weather, ecosystem collapse, and food crises. Extreme heat is particularly exacerbated by the urban heat island (UHI) effect in cities. Numerous stud-ies have empirically investigated the link between ur-ban form factors and surface Urban Heat Islands (UHI), but few have studied how UHI changes in response to an extreme heat event, conceptualized as heat resilience in recent studies. Additionally, the majority of existing studies have relied on traditional regression models that assume linear relationships. To address this gap, this study aims to identify nonlinear relationships between urban form factors and land surface temperature (LST) and heat resilience, using machine learning methods. The GBDT models demonstrated superior predictive ac-curacy, as evidenced by the lowest mean squared error (MSE).  In addition, the results indicate that the urban form factors have nonlinearity relationships with urban land surface extreme heat and the associated heat resili-ence. These findings have valuable implications for ur-ban planning practice aimed at developing heat-resilient cities.
