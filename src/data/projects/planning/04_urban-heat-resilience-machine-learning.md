## abstract: 
"Climate change has been a pressing global issue in recent decades as it increasingly influences human life through extreme weather, ecosystem collapse, and food crises. Extreme heat is particularly exacerbated by the urban heat island (UHI) effect in cities. Numerous studies have empirically investigated the link between urban form factors and surface Urban Heat Islands (UHI), but few have studied how UHI changes in response to an extreme heat event, conceptualized as heat resilience in recent studies. Additionally, the majority of existing studies have relied on traditional regression models that assume linear relationships. To address this gap, this study aims to identify nonlinear relationships between urban form factors and land surface temperature (LST) and heat resilience, using machine learning methods. The GBDT models demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, as evidenced by the lowest mean squared error (MSE). In addition, the results indicate that urban form factors have nonlinear relationships with urban land surface extreme heat and associated heat resilience. These findings have valuable implications for urban planning practice aimed at developing heat-resilient cities."

## 1 - Extreme Heat Days and Normal Heat Days Identification

### 1.1 Extreme Heat Day Definition

This section defines the criteria for identifying extreme heat days and normal heat days in the study area.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Official Definition** | Extreme heat is defined as a period during which the apparent temperature exceeds 33°C for at least two consecutive days, or when rapid temperature increases or prolonged heatwaves are expected to result in significant or widespread harm, based on the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). |
| **Selection Criteria** | Based on duration, intensity, and potential damage impact |
| **Reference Links** | [KMA Wind Chill Data](https://data.kma.go.kr/climate/windChill/selectWindChillChart.do?pgmNo=111) |
| **Temporal Scope** | In Korea, summer spans May to September. Therefore, percentile analysis uses data from months 5-9 |
| **Data Source** | [KMA Statistical Data](https://data.kma.go.kr/climate/RankState/selectRankStatisticsDivisionList.do?pgmNo=179) |
| **Extreme Heat Threshold** | Apparent Temperature (AT) > 95th percentile |
| **Normal Heat Range** | Apparent Temperature (AT) between 40th-60th percentile |

## 2 - Weather Station Selection and Data Processing

### 2.1 Station Selection Process

For accurate temperature analysis, we selected the weather station with the most comprehensive data coverage. After evaluating available stations, **Station ID 108** was chosen for its complete historical records.

![Air Station Selection](https://github.com/LiliLIN0324/GBDT/blob/ec441c372473eb65e3636e4b9b75d98f034be8ad/excel/air_station_select.png?raw=true)

### 2.2 Temperature Data Analysis (2015-2024)

The analysis revealed challenges in finding suitable comparison days. For instance, June 16th, 2023, initially appeared to be a normal heat day, but heavy rainfall two days prior significantly affected the temperature patterns.

![Weather Conditions](https://github.com/LiliLIN0324/GBDT/blob/ec441c372473eb65e3636e4b9b75d98f034be8ad/excel/其他天情况.png?raw=true) 
![Weather Condition Pairs](https://github.com/LiliLIN0324/GBDT/blob/ec441c372473eb65e3636e4b9b75d98f034be8ad/excel/weather_condition_on_pairs.png?raw=true) 

#### Final Comparison Pairs:
- **20160924 vs 20160807** (Extreme vs Normal heat day)
- **20230616 vs 20230819** (Extreme vs Normal heat day)

## 3 - Landsat Data Processing and Feature Variables

### 3.1 Landsat Surface Temperature Data

After identifying extreme heat days (apparent temperature >33°C and percentile >95%), we downloaded corresponding satellite data from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 8/9.

**Data Source:** [USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-temperature)

download link: https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/

#### Temperature Conversion Formula
To properly interpret Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature (ST) data, users must apply a scaling factor to convert digital numbers (DN) to temperature values in Kelvin:

```bash
ST = (DN * 0.00341802) + 149.0
```

### 3.2 Urban Form Feature Variables

| **Data Cleaning** | **Step 1**: Applied area threshold ≥ 5 m² using `data[data['area'] >= 5]` |
